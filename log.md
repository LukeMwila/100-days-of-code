# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Publish an npm package module for React and developed a simple multi view modal also for ReactJS.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to get in the habit of publishing at least one npm module that can be used as a nifty tool by others developing in React or Angular. The multiview modal was more to keep my skills sharp by developing React components in a smarter way than I've done so in the past.
